            <h3>For the rice</h3>
            <ol class="ollist">
                <li>Rince  and strain the rice several times until the water is mostly clear.</li>
                <li>Strain the rice and place in your preffered cooking pot.</li>
                <li>Add two times the amount of water as there is for rice. ex. 1 cup of rice means 2 cups of water. Optional: Let the rice sit for an hour before cooking.</li>
                <li>Now we cook the rice. If you have a rice cooker then just put the rice and water into the rice cooker and set to cook. If not we will use the 5-5-5 rule. Turn the stove to high until the water comes to a boil. Once boiling turn it down to medium and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Next, turn the heat dowm to very low and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Finally, turn the stove top off and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>If the rice is too moist, stir it and then put the rice back on low heat without the lid for a few more minutes until it is to your liking.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>For the beans</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place beans in a saucepan and cover with 4 cups of water to 1 cup of beans.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil for 2 minutes, then leave to stand for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Now we cook the beans. Return the pan to the heat and simmer until beans are soft. 1-3 hours. Note: Check frequently to ensure not to overcook the beans.</li>
                <li>Finally, serve together on a dish, bowl, or cup and enjoy!</li>
