    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Robust rice and beans!
    <br>Great for a family gathering or for dining alone. This dish is always a sensation!(When you're on a budget)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
   <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rince  and strain the rice several times until the water is mostly clear.</li>
        <li>Strain the rice and place in your preffered cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Add two times the amount of water as there is for rice. <br>
            ex. 1 cup of rice means 2 cups of water.
            Optional: Let the rice sit for an hour before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Now we cook the rice. If you have a rice cooker then just put the rice and water into the rice cooker and set to cook.
            If not we will use the 5-5-5 rule.
            Turn the stove to high until the water comes to a boil.
            Once boiling turn it down to medium and let it sit for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Next, turn the heat dowm to very low and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Finally, turn the stove top off and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>If the rice is too moist, stir it and then put the rice back on low heat without the lid for a few more minutes until it is to your liking.</li>
 
    </ol>
    <h3>For the beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place beans in a saucepan and cover with 4 cups of water to 1 cup of beans.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil for 2 minutes, then leave to stand for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Now we cook the beans. Return the pan to the heat and simmer until beans are soft. 1-3 hours
           <br>Note: Check frequently to ensure not to overcook the beans.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finally, serve together on a dish, bowl, or cup and enjoy!</p>
