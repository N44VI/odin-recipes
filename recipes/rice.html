                <li>Rince  and strain the rice several times until the water is mostly clear.</li>
                <li>Strain the rice and place in your preffered cooking pot.</li>
                <li>Add two times the amount of water as there is for rice. <br>
                    ex. 1 cup of rice means 2 cups of water.
                    Optional: Let the rice sit for an hour before cooking.
                </li>
                <li>Now we cook the rice. If you have a rice cooker then just put the rice and water into the rice cooker and set to cook.
                    If not we will use the 5-5-5 rule.
                    Turn the stove to high until the water comes to a boil.
                    Once boiling turn it down to medium and let it sit for 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Next, turn the heat dowm to very low and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Finally, turn the stove top off and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>If the rice is too moist, stir it and then put the rice back on low heat without the lid for a few more minutes until it is to your liking.</li>
