        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Decadent bowl of rice.
        <br>Great for a family gathering or for dining alone. This dish is always a sensation!(When you're on a budget)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice(short grain preferable)</li>
            <li>water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rince  and strain the rice several times until the water is mostly clear.</li>
            <li>Strain the rice and place in your preffered cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Add two times the amount of water as there is for rice. <br>
                ex. 1 cup of rice means 2 cups of water.
                Optional: Let the rice sit for an hour before cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Now we cook the rice. If you have a rice cooker then just put the rice and water into the rice cooker and set to cook.
                If not we will use the 5-5-5 rule.
                Turn the stove to high until the water comes to a boil.
                Once boiling turn it down to medium and let it sit for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Next, turn the heat dowm to very low and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Finally, turn the stove top off and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>If the rice is too moist, stir it and then put the rice back on low heat without the lid for a few more minutes until it is to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
